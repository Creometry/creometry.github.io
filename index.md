## Welcome to Creometry

Intro

### Why incentive-driven?

- Building a Data-center requires a high capital expenditure, a cheap source of energy nearby and a centralized large network bandwith.
- Paying for online and on-demand "cloud services" requires a minimal banking infrastructure and access to foreign currency reserves.


## Create (for devs)
- Build apps
   Create a web-based business delivered throu a web-application that is built from small components (functions in containers).
   
- Create Value incentives: (make it rain)
   Identify an attractive economic value in the business provided through the web-app, then use that value to pay a community of volunteers for hosting the application components.

## Compute (for cloud miners)
  1. Bring Your Own Machine: dedicated bare-Metal or shared resources (virtual machine)
  2. Download the OS/Stack: planning to support ARM64 and AMD64 
  3. Select which incentives you would like to earn: incentives can be associated with one particular app component or with all apps belonging to one particular organization.
  4. Earn digital value redeemable in-app/in-store within the issuing organization.
  

## Trade (for liquidity)
- Trade a digital value for another according to a market price determined by offer and demand. 
- 'Gutta' is the unit of market prices. It is considered creometry's native virtual currency, eliminating the need for a fiat currency.
- Trade volume limits are determined by the application owners and apply to each and every incentive issued on the network. 

Note 1: Volume limits can be any positive balance of Gutta (>0), and are meant to minimize price fluctuation and preserve interest in the intrinsic value (i.e. value redemption). Thus establishing a relationship between hosts and organizations based on economic interest rather than allowing most network nodes to dedicate their capacity for a particular asset/org because of its attractive price or its shiny brand name. 

Note 2: Nodes hosting containers for creometry's exachange app will earn Gutta.
