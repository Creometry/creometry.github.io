## Welcome to Creometry

Intro

### Why incentive-driven?

- Building a Data-center requires a high capital expenditure, a cheap source of energy nearby and a centralized large network bandwith.
- Paying for online and on-demand "cloud services" requires a minimal banking infrastructure and access to foreign currency reserves.


# Create (for devs)
- Build apps
   Create a web-based business delivered throu a web-application that is built from small components (functions in     containers).
   
- Create Value incentives: (make it rain)
   Identify an attractive economic value in the business provided through the web-app, then use that value to pay a community of volunteers for hosting the application components.

# Compute (for cloud miners)
  1. Bring Your Own Machine: Bare-Metal and Shared machine (Virtualized)
  2. Download the OS/Stack: support for ARM64 and AMD64
  3. Select which incentives you would like to earn: incentives can be associated with one particular app component or with all apps belonging to one particular organization.
  4. Earn digital value redeemable in-app/in-store within the issuing organization.
  
 # Trade: for liquidity 
- Trade a digital value for another according to a market price determined by offer and demand. 
- 'Gutta' the unit of market prices, replacing fiat currency.
- Trade volume limits are determined by the application owners and apply to each and every asset issued on the network. Limits are meant to minimize price fluctuation and preserve interest in the intrinsic value (i.e. redemption) rather than allowing most network nodes to dedicate their capacity for a particular asset/org because of its attractive price or its shiny brand name.
